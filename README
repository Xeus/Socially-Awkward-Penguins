Homework Assignment #1
----------------------
I created a random walk using the Socially-Awkward Penguin meme.
The penguins try to avoid contact or communication with each other.

Issues:
-Penguins tend to flock and eventually disappear along the sides.
-Boundaries of penguins' squares are not bounded -- overlap between penguins.
-Penguins not moving precisely to avoid each other.  Velocities interfering?
